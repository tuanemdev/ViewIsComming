# ViewIsComming

**ViewIsComming** is a Swift Package Manager (SPM) library engineered to significantly expand SwiftUI's transition capabilities.
It provides a rich collection of powerful, custom `Transition` effects, empowering developers to easily implement smooth, unique,
and complex entrance and exit animations for their Views.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Extended Transitions Library**: Introduces a comprehensive library of professional, predefined `Transition` types
that go beyond the default options offered by SwiftUI.
* **Complex, Ready-to-Use Effects**: Offers sophisticated transition effects (such as flips, rotations, arc slides, etc.)
that can be applied with a single line of code.
* **Seamless SwiftUI Integration**: New transitions fully conform to the `Transition` protocol, ensuring perfect
and immediate integration with SwiftUI's native `transition(_:)` modifier.
* **Customizable & Composable**: Effects can be easily parameterized and combined (composited) to create highly unique
and custom transition experiences.
